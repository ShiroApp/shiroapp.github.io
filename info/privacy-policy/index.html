    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>This document entails the privacy policy and agreement that you accept when adding Shiro to a server, or as a member of the community/support. This document does not supersede the <a href="https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/legal">Discord Terms of Service</a>.</p>

    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Server Manager</strong> - Anyone who has the ability to add the bot to a server or configure the Bot for the server. This is usually an administrator or moderator.</li>
        <li><strong>Server Member</strong> - Anyone who is a member of server to which the Bot has been added.</li>
        <li><strong>Server User</strong> - Anyone who authorizes an application (logs in) for a scope that provides additional information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>When you use Shiro, we may collect the following information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Discord ID</strong> - To associate your account with the bot and enable certain features.</li>
        <li><strong>Messages</strong> - For the purpose of processing your requests. These messages are mostly deleted once processed, except for some command or in a case of moderation where a log is kept for the purpose of carrying out the bot's functions.</li>
        <li><strong>Commands Usage</strong> - For troubleshooting purposes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All stored data is kept on protected servers. While storage methods vary, most data is kept within password-protected servers. Please keep in mind that even with these protections, no data can be 100% secure. All efforts are taken to keep your data secure and private, but its absolute security cannot be guaranteed.</p>

    <h2>Agreement</h2>
    <p>By adding the Bot to your server or using the Bot in any way, you are consenting to the policies outlines in this document. In addition, you ("The Server Manager") are agreeing to inform your members of the <a href="https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/legal">Discord Terms of Service</a> and the contents of this document. If you, the Server Member, do not agree to this document, you may leave the server that contains the bot. If you, the User, do not agree to this document, you may revoke authorization of the application in your 'Authorized Apps' menu.</p>
